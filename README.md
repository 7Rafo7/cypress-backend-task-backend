## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

You need to run both backend & frontend,
then you register some users & select them role(user registration is simple because there was nothing about it:D)
& the rest data, after login system will recognise user role & will redirect the specific for that role page.

Sorry for poor css :D
